# State and Props 
    - Props (Properties)
        - All the incoming data to a component 
        - props cannot be directly modified 
    - State 
        - the data preserved by the component 
        - state can be managed within the component 

# Component 
    - A reusable code block of react which defines some views

    Types:
        a. Functional / Stateless 
        b. Class Based / statefull

# Life Cycle Of a component 
    3 stages 

    a. Mounting 
        - from load to updating a state 
        
        a. constructor()
            - set default state 
            - receive props 
            - initialize the component 

        b. render()
            - view call 
            - with every state change, the render function will auto run 

        c. componentDidMount()
            - one time call, on first render 

    b. Updating 
        a. render()
            - second call 
        b. componentDidUpdated();

    c. Unmounting 
        - componentDidUnmount


React Hook 
    a. State Hook 
        - to maintain state in react component

    b. Effect Hook 
        - side-effect
